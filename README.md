# Case Study: Bike-Sharing Company Dataset Analysis

## Introduction

This is my take for dicoding's data analysis course using python. As you can see in the top right corner of this page, there is a link that will direct you to the deployed streamlit dashboard. There is also a `notebook.ipynb` where you can see my _oret-oretan_.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of a two-year historical log from the Capital Bikeshare system in Washington D.C. (2011-2012). It captures detailed travel information, influenced by environmental and seasonal factors like weather, time of year, and time of day. Bike-sharing systems automate the rental process, offering flexibility and addressing urban issues like traffic and health.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Importing Data

Essential libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are utilized for data manipulation and visualization.

### 2. Data Wrangling

The data is prepared through initial exploration, handling missing or duplicate values, data formatting, normalization, and binning.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The analysis includes descriptive statistics that reveal the average bike rental count, user behavior, and seasonal patterns. Registered users show significantly higher engagement than casual users, with rental peaks during summer, weekends, and mild weather.

### 4. Correlations

A correlation matrix identifies relationships between variables, indicating that temperature positively influences bike rentals while high humidity negatively affects them.

### 5. Visualizations

Various plots visualize user trends, such as peak rental times and seasonal variations. Key insights include:

- Higher rentals in warmer months and lower activity during winter.
- Registered users dominate weekday rentals, while casual users peak on weekends.
- Moderate temperatures correlate with increased rider activity.

## Conclusion

The case study emphasizes the role of data analysis in understanding bike-sharing systems. Factors like weather, seasonality, and user type are crucial for optimizing operations and enhancing user satisfaction. The insights gained can inform strategic decisions for improving bike-sharing services and urban transportation solutions.
